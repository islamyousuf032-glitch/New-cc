# Build and test

## Experimental clip preview checks (2026-10-24)

Make6/Release CTest6/6, strict JNI/real JVM, production pure Kotlin2.3.21 -Werror tests
pass. PreviewProgress additionally tests all1001 positions at Long.MAX_VALUE against
BigInteger, invalid bounds and clipping-relative progress.298bilingual strings/3themes,
17labels,7metadata/3install-over checks pass. No Android stubs were used for host passes.

LiveColorPreviewTest raw output-format/gate source added, Android UNCOMPILED/UNRUN.
Build/lint + actual opt-in decoder/GL/audio/graph/texture/seek/loop/cancel/release/pixel tests
are required, not replaced by host checks. ExoPlayer is explicitly pinned1.8.1; no new GPU
result/APK/install-over acceptance. Before disabled while paused (no replay cache); see ADR0022.


## Color editing batch checks (2026-10-23)

Release CTest6/6 passed. Production pure Kotlin2.3.21 -Werror with actual JNI additionally
compiles ColorFrameBuffers/ColorGradeDraft: real ARGB native pixels128->176, alpha/hidden
RGB/source/bypass/shape and Bengali numeric parsing passed.294 bilingual strings/all3themes
and17labels per language,7metadata/3install-over tests pass. No Android stubs used for host
passes. ColorStillPreviewTest and candidate pre-cancel tests added, UNCOMPILED/UNRUN.

Android app/dialog/Bitmap retrieval/lint, real exportGradedCandidate codec run/output parity,
rotation/provider cancellation/memory, phone/live graded playback and install-over remain
open. Test candidate is not enabled by the delivery UI. APK unavailable; see ADR0021.


## Decoded color gate checks (2026-10-23)

Make6/Release CTest6/6 and decoded/source/GPU ASan+UBSan passed. Existing strict JNI
compile command applies unchanged. Actual JVM tests now exercise12-int expected/output
blocks, malformed/null shapes/flags, changed geometry/tags/range/HDR rejection. Optional
production Kotlin/native runner includes DecoderColorGate.kt; -Werror2.3.21 checks repeated
format validation, late changes, unknown output and terminal failure/close alongside prior
plan/projection/pixel tests. No synthetic Android stubs are used for these host passes.

GuardedDecoderTest is new Android synthetic Codec-proxy source, **uncompiled/unrun**.
Both surface overloads, timestamp/drop/cleanup/owner-thread assertions require Android
runner validation. Real MediaCodec/output pixels and live preview/export are separate.
CI39958756231 annotation says job not started due to billing/spending, not compiler proof.
Candidate.configure now requires (context,builder) to bind guarded asset loader AND GL
factory. No APK, codec, performance or install-over result. See ADR0020.


## Phase 1C source/plan checks (2026-10-23)

Six Make/Release CTest suites and source/GPU ASan+UBSan pass. Existing full host JNI
compile command still applies. run_host_jni now tests native source admission across200
canonical metadata combinations plus HDR-static conflict refusal. Optional third-library
mode in run_host_kotlin additionally compiles production ColorRenderPlan/ColorEngine/
TimelineSnapshot with Kotlin2.3.21 -Werror and runs real JNI: immutable grades, dedup,
metadata/geometry mismatch, cancellation and failure publication tests pass.

ColorSourcePlanTest adds Android raw-tag mapping/candidate effect-clipping/guard checks;
**uncompiled/unrun**. Platform probe, Media3 candidate/codec and preview integration are
not covered by pure Kotlin tests. CI39950781623 did not start (billing/spending annotation).
Prior96-case software GLES result is unchanged prior evidence, not rerun this checkpoint.
No APK, phone/performance/encoded parity/install-over proof. See ADR0019.


## Phase 1C foundation checks (2026-10-23)

Make six suites and Release CMake/CTest **6/6** passed. New owncut_color_gpu_tests passed
ASan+UBSan. Full strict production JNI build, actual JVM recipe validation and production
pure Kotlin 2.3.21 -Werror recipe/CPU bridge passed. Host JNI builds **must additionally
include engine/color/src/color_gpu.cpp**; no new runtime dependency.

Run original production GLSL against its C++ reference using developer-provided EGL/GLES:

```sh
# Linux Mesa software renderer (installed by portable CI; new CI step not verified yet)
EGL_PLATFORM=surfaceless LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 python3 tests/run_host_gpu.py \
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libEGL.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLESv2.so.2
# Alternatively cached ANGLE/SwiftShader libraries (actual local validation):
OWNCUT_SWIFTSHADER=1 VK_ICD_FILENAMES="$DRIVER/vk_swiftshader_icd.json" \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$DRIVER" python3 tests/run_host_gpu.py "$DRIVER/libEGL.so" "$DRIVER/libGLESv2.so"
```

The script downloads nothing and uses temporary original probes; `g++`, EGL/GLES libraries
and an offscreen-capable driver are prerequisites. Local renderer was ANGLE 2.1.24077 /
SwiftShader driver 5.0.0, OpenGL ES 3.1.0 (compiles GLES2 GLSL). **96 cases ×512 pixels**,
max RGB error **1/255**, exact alpha and identity/disabled/zero strength passed. RGB gate
is <=2/255, a sampled SDR byte comparison, not all-parameters or HDR/hardware proof.

**Unrun:** full Android/adapter/test compilation, GradeGpuContractTest synthetic GLES
smoke (SDR gray 128→184, not sRGB 128→176), unknown/HDR metadata gates, Media3 processor
conversion, codec/rendered-output parity, phone, install-over. Run opt-in connected tests
only in the appropriate device environment; user owns phone testing. No new APK.


## Phase 1B checks (2026-10-23)

Make/CTest now have **five** suites; owncut_grade_project_tests covers grade history,
edit inheritance, v0/v1 fixtures/v2 codec, corrupt/future refusal, snapshots and six
checkpoint boundaries. CMake Release/CTest 5/5 and grade/project ASan+UBSan passed.
Host JNI fixtures now exercise nativeSetClipGrades, full-precision grade snapshots,
undo/redo/bypass, invalid batches and persisted reload under -Xcheck:jni. Production
pure Kotlin cache tests additionally compile ColorEngine.kt for immutable DTO types.
No synthetic Android stubs/full app compilation are implied. ClipGradePersistenceTest
adds managed-grade recovery and export refusal assertions for an Android runner; unrun.
Existing host JNI/Kotlin build commands remain applicable. Export guard behavior in the
Android codec adapter is source/instrumentation-test coverage only, not a passed device test.

## Color phase 1A checks (2026-10-23)

`make test` now runs **four** suites; CTest includes owncut_color_tests. The color suite
covers all 17 parameter bounds/nonfinite inputs, real pixels/alpha, identity, stride/
overlap/overflow/cancellation, histograms, preset bounds/versions and tile equivalence.
CMake Release/CTest 4/4 and color ASan+UBSan passed locally.

Host JNI builds must now include **platform/android/jni/color_jni.cpp**,
**engine/color/src/color.cpp**, and **-Iengine/color/include**. The documented compile
command below includes these; run_host_jni exercises both native session and color APIs.

```sh
python3 tests/run_host_kotlin.py "$JAVA_HOME" "$KOTLIN_HOME" /tmp/libowncut_host.so
```

The optional third argument additionally compiles production ColorEngine.kt + the
original ColorBridgeTest, loads the actual library in a temporary location and runs
Kotlin→JNI→C++ under -Xcheck:jni. It passed using Kotlin 2.3.21 and cache-only Java 25;
Android CI's JDK 17 pin is unchanged. No synthetic Android stubs are used. This does
not compile/test the full Android app, GPU/video pipeline or ART. New Android contract
sources exist but are unrun. No new APK; no device/codec/performance claim.

## New lifetime/projection checks (2026-10-23)

`make test` and CTest now compile SessionRegistry. Native tests include pinned calls
surviving close, rejected invalid/stale handles and 320 parallel create/close tokens.
The optional real-JVM JNI script also checks revision pages, parallel destroy/read and
forged handles. Add `engine/session/src/session_registry.cpp` when building host JNI.

Optional production pure Kotlin test (compiler matches pinned app Kotlin **2.3.21**):

```sh
python3 tests/run_host_kotlin.py "$JAVA_HOME" "$KOTLIN_HOME"
```

It compiles TimelineSnapshot/TimelineClipIndex with `-Werror` and runs the original
fixture without Android stubs. Generated JARs are temporary. This passed using cache-only
Java 25.0.2 and the official Kotlin compiler distribution via npm `kotlin-compiler@2.3.21`
(registry SHA512 integrity verified); neither changes the Android JDK 17 build pin.
It is **not** a full app/EngineSession/TimelineView/Android compilation. Android
TimelinePagingTest sources are added; their compile/run remains pending. Latest CMake
3/3, session/registry ASan+UBSan, strict native JNI and real-JVM checks also passed.

## Current fast validation and phone handoff — 2026-10-23

Default Android CI runs resource/patch guards, all three native suites, Android APK
build/lint/AndroidTest-source compilation and alignment. Emulator/render/install-over
are **not** run on push; dispatch with `run_device_tests=true` explicitly requests them.
A requested device failure blocks publication. A signed candidate without those runs
must say `deviceValidation=not-run`, never "device verified". Approved-signer/package/
version checks still apply. The user owns phone testing; see ADR 0014 and UPDATE_APKS.

Latest local results: Make three suites, CMake Release/CTest 3/3, checkpoint ASan+UBSan,
strict host JNI shared-library build, real JVM `-Xcheck:jni`, 279 resource/theme checks,
7 metadata and 3 install-over guard tests, and workflow syntax/guard checks all passed.
Android/Kotlin compilation, codecs, emulator/phone/update installation remain unrun for
this batch. No new APK. Older entries below describe earlier checkpoints.

### Optional Linux host JVM JNI smoke test

Use a local JDK with JNI headers and install `JPype1==1.7.1` into an isolated development
environment (not an app dependency). Build the production JNI against its headers:

```sh
c++ -std=c++20 -O2 -shared -fPIC -pthread -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic \
  -I"$JAVA_HOME/include" -I"$JAVA_HOME/include/linux" \
  -Iengine/color/include -Iengine/session/include -Iengine/core/include -Iengine/timeline/include \
  -Iengine/commands/include -Iengine/project/include \
  platform/android/jni/editor_jni.cpp platform/android/jni/color_jni.cpp \
  engine/color/src/color_gpu.cpp engine/color/src/color.cpp engine/session/src/session_registry.cpp \
  engine/session/src/session_coordinator.cpp \
  engine/core/src/time.cpp engine/timeline/src/timeline.cpp \
  engine/commands/src/command_history.cpp engine/project/src/project.cpp \
  -o /tmp/libowncut_host.so
python3 tests/run_host_jni.py "$JAVA_HOME" /tmp/libowncut_host.so
```

The script generates original fixture bytecode (no `javac` needed), runs the actual
production class/symbol bindings under `-Xcheck:jni` and removes temporary documents.
It tests Unicode, native exceptions, UUID input, session isolation, >256 clips,
media catalog and checkpoint/repair. This is **not** Kotlin/ART/Android/codec testing.
The local run used cache-only Java 25.0.2 with official OpenJDK 17 JNI headers; Android
CI still uses its pinned JDK 17. No generated JVM binaries are checked in.

## Portable C++ core

Requirements: GCC or Clang with C++20. CMake 3.20+ is supported.

```sh
make test
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

`make test` builds/runs `/tmp/owncut_{color,core,session,checkpoint}_tests`, avoiding generated binaries in the repository. CMake build output belongs in ignored `build/`.

## Android app shell and JNI smoke test

Pinned baseline: JDK 17, Gradle 8.13 (wrapper SHA-256 verification enabled), AGP 8.13.2, Kotlin Gradle plugin 2.3.21, compile/target SDK 36, min SDK 26, NDK 28.2.13676358, CMake 3.22.1. These are exact versions, not dynamic selectors; compatibility sources are recorded in ADR 0002. The Gradle wrapper JAR is upstream Gradle v8.13.0 and SHA-256 checked against Gradle's published wrapper checksum.

With Android SDK packages installed (`platforms;android-36`, `build-tools;36.0.0`, `ndk;28.2.13676358`, `cmake;3.22.1`) run:

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:lintDebug
./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/36.0.0/zipalign -c -P 16 -v 4 app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Instrumentation sources cover native library load, media-reference clip insertion and timeline snapshots, move/relink/split/trim/ripple-delete, undo/redo, project save/load, autosave recovery/clear, bounded SAF project-byte copy, remux-export plan constraints, native session close, and MainActivity launch/initial TextureView presence. They do not yet execute codec remux against real media. It does not exercise actual codec playback, UI editing gestures, or full lifecycle flows. The workflow builds/lints, compiles Android instrumentation sources, and checks APK alignment before emulator startup. On pushes to the fixed Arena branch it publishes a private, explicitly named `phone-test-*` prerelease containing the arm64-v8a/x86_64 debug APK and SHA-256 file, so a slow/failing emulator does not block manual phone testing. It also attempts an Actions artifact upload; the repository's artifact storage quota is currently full. The latest published APK is `phone-test-39270709637` from commit `7c06312`. Android build/lint, AndroidTest source compilation, APK alignment, and release publication passed; emulator instrumentation is still running. It includes SAF project Save As/Open, same-track drag/reorder, selected/group media relink, Linux/Android local fsync, and the frame-rounding/gap-compaction remux fix. These workflows still need physical-phone/provider testing. The guarded keyframe-aligned stream-copy exporter was first in APK `phone-test-39262430899`; user screenshots exposed its overly strict sub-frame duration check and gap rejection. APK `phone-test-39270709637` fixes the duration rounding and confirmed gap compaction. New source work additionally joins multiple URIs only if their video/audio codec configuration and track formats match, then reopens the output to validate tracks/timestamps and decodes its first frame before copying to SAF; incompatible sources fail safely. Regression-test source now covers three clips from several media references, frame rounding, gap compaction and overlap rejection. This additional work has not yet had Android build/lint or device-media verification. Actual export playback remains untested. The workflow skips instrumentation with a clear warning when KVM is unavailable. A debug APK is for manual testing only, not production. Neither CI nor the APK validates broad codec/GPU/audio support, edited-timeline render, A/V sync, or export correctness. NDK r28+ enables 16 KB ELF alignment by default; zipalign validates package alignment. A physical 16 KB ARM64 device/emulator run remains outstanding.

This local environment has no JDK, Gradle, Android SDK/NDK, CMake/Ninja, `adb`, or emulator/device, so Android tasks cannot be run here. Do not interpret host tests as Android validation.

## Environment audit at initial implementation

Linux x86_64; GCC 12.2.0 and Python 3 available. Java/Javac, Gradle, CMake, Ninja, Clang, `adb`, `sdkmanager`, and `ndk-build` were not found; common Android SDK paths were absent. No emulator/device or CI runner is attached to this local environment. The checked-in wrapper is present, but cannot run without Java. Outbound checks to allowed GitHub/npm/PyPI hosts succeeded; this does not verify Android dependency downloads.

### Gallery publication follow-up

Android 10+ export saves validated MP4s automatically to `Movies/Owncut` using a pending MediaStore row; no document picker is shown. Android 8–9 retain the SAF picker. Failed/cancelled copies attempt cleanup; provider deletion may fail. Existing empty files are not automatically removed. Device checks must cover successful Gallery thumbnail/playback, cancellation, unsupported-keyframe/format rejection without a new Gallery item, and storage/write failure cleanup. This does not add re-encoding or `.ccraw` decoding; the custom RAW format specification and sample footage are still required. Android/device verification of this publication change is pending.

## Basic render checkpoint (2026-10-21, emulator verified)

Default export now routes through `TimelineRenderExporter` (Media3 1.8.1) instead of
stream-copy. The native timeline snapshot supplies clip order and source trim ranges;
Android decodes/renders/re-encodes H.264 + AAC, source video cadence, 720-high SDR, preserving aspect
ratio. A silent audio track is generated where necessary. Gap removal still needs
confirmation; overlaps/multitrack export remain rejected. Import/play/edit are existing
features; RAW and grading are explicitly deferred until basic acceptance is complete.

New real-media instrumentation covers untouched input, non-keyframe trim, three clips
with different resolutions/aspects and a silent source, duration, output first/last
frames and pre-start cancellation. Synthetic fixture provenance is in androidTest/assets.
Run `39603413359` executed the instrumentation suite successfully, including the
new real-media render cases. Galaxy F23 playback/A/V sync, mid-render cancellation,
Gallery thumbnails and lifecycle still need physical-device verification. APK publication
is gated after emulator instrumentation and `phone-test-39603413359` is published; do not distribute the prior remux APK as this
render checkpoint. Earlier remux-only descriptions above are historical, not the new
selected UI path.

## Basic reliability milestone (emulator regression verified)

Next scope selected by the user: basic editor hardening, not grading/RAW or MVP tools.
New source guards grouped-source relink durations, blocks edits during project I/O,
retains editor history/selection on export-time recreation while cancelling the old
render, preserves paused preview position and clamps seeks to the selected clip.
Gallery publication now uses a testable pending-row transaction with copy/close/size/
publish checks and explicit cleanup-failure reporting. Output duration and first/last
frame decoding are checked before publication. Android run `39620910796` executed the expanded JNI, real-codec, Activity
recreation, MediaStore and injected storage-failure suite successfully after the
initial regression failures were fixed. Build/lint and 16 KB alignment also passed.
Published APK: `phone-test-39620910796` from `4fc4590` (6,809,848 bytes).

Phone checks still needed: exact A/V sync, permission revocation/provider save/reopen,
low storage, Samsung lifecycle/process death. SAVE/LOAD/RECOVER-time recreation still
uses explicit autosave recovery, not background operation handoff. No provider-atomic
replacement, write-ahead journal, full shared preview/export graph, multitrack, grading
or RAW claim is added. Existing user-confirmed 5–6-clip 720p rendering remains valid.

### Reliability checkpoint results

Media import now participates in C++ AddClipCommand Undo/Redo history, including
last-import undo clearing preview. MP4 validation iterates by sample-track index so
negative AAC pre-roll timestamps are not mistaken for EOF. Regression tests were
not weakened after the first failing run. New hardening has emulator evidence, not
a new Galaxy F23 report; that phone's successful 5–6-clip render report concerns the
previous basic-render APK. Project schema is unchanged and reopen resets transient
history, as before. Save important work as a project document before changing debug
APK installations; do not delete app data to resolve installation errors without backup.

## Timeline interaction checkpoint — verified emulator batch (2026-10-22)

User reports the basic-hardening APK works correctly on their phone, with some
unspecified remaining issues. This requested batch adds an original red timeline
playhead, HH:MM:SS:FF ruler/time label, unified lane scrolling, tap-to-seek, marker-head
scrubbing, follow toggle/manual browse, proportional short clips/adaptive long scale,
source/sequence time separation and Undo anchor preservation. Native C++ owns point
lookup, exclusive clip boundaries and gap/overlap validation. Android preview now
requests closest-frame seeks and waits for initial seek completion before playback.
No project schema/output-preset/new dependency or advanced-tool/RAW claim is added.

See DECISIONS/0008 for research, clock/conversion/interaction details and test scope.
Host `make test` and `git diff --check` passed. Final code `8f5df51` passed
portable CI `39728248775` and Android CI `39728248796` (job `119657088154`):
APK build/lint, AndroidTest compilation, 16 KB alignment and the full Android 35
x86_64 emulator suite, including the new Canvas/touch/JNI/real-MediaPlayer seek,
playback advancement, split/Undo and non-selected clip move/source checks. Existing
render, publication, project-I/O and lifecycle tests also passed.
Phone-test prerelease: `phone-test-39728248796`, target
`8f5df51622fec4bd29542921875b330905c475b9`, APK 6,834,920 bytes.
This is emulator evidence, not a new physical-phone validation report.
Device checks still needed: red-marker smoothness/latency, fast repeated seeks, long
clip/zoomed timeline ergonomics, TalkBack/large fonts, source codecs and exact A/V sync.
The prior export gap-confirmation and single-track render limitations remain.


Final-batch APK: https://github.com/islamyousuf032-glitch/New-cc/releases/download/phone-test-39728248796/app-debug.apk
Checksum: the same release's `app-debug.apk.sha256` asset. Both assets were verified
as uploaded using release metadata; the target commit matches the tested source.
Full zipped Actions logs were not retrievable in this sandbox (redirect host EOF).
Actions report artifact upload hit repository storage quota; this non-gating upload
failure does not invalidate the successful emulator step or the published release.
Detailed XML/lint artifacts were therefore not independently downloaded/inspected;
verification above refers to the explicit successful CI steps, not an invented count.
No production signing/update-key scheme is introduced: save projects before changing
debug installations. If Android reports signature mismatch, do not erase app data
without a project backup and a deliberate recovery/relink plan.


## Project-workspace / node architecture baseline (2026-10-22)

The user reports the playhead APK works well on their phone; this is user smoke
evidence, not an independent sync/performance benchmark. [Advanced architecture v1](ADVANCED_ARCHITECTURE.md)
and ADR 0009 now define the canonical forward design; earlier checkpoint descriptions
above are historical. The baseline distinguishes timeline editorial time, typed node
processing, contextual workspace UI, managed persistence and future shared evaluation.

This implementation adds a launcher project library (create/name/import/list/open),
per-project native save/recovery, non-destructive legacy workspace discovery, managed
checkpoint on Projects/Back, retained workspace pages and Edit/Media/Deliver panels.
Flow is a read-only explanation of the current separate preview/export routes. Native
`engine/graph` validates a bounded typed output DAG but has no renderer, JNI or file
schema integration. No advanced grading/audio/RAW/compositor or output-preset claim.

Host tests and Android verification for this batch are recorded in the final evidence
entry below when executed. Physical-phone verification of this new navigation is pending.
Test on phone: create two projects, import/edit/back/reopen isolation, external Save As,
legacy recovery, large fonts/rotation, media relink, render/Gallery, and Back during I/O.


### Executed architecture-batch evidence

Final implementation `f652c381316d209eb6be2bb5b736c89ede802e12` passed Android
run `39748116540` / job `119721585167`: APK build/lint, AndroidTest compilation,
16 KB alignment, KVM and full Android 35 x86_64 instrumentation. New catalog tests
cover isolated documents, names/path validation, non-destructive/idempotent legacy
migration, malformed/oversized metadata with valid cards preserved, launcher routing,
managed checkpoint/reopen and retained workspace page without replacing the viewer.
Existing playhead/JNI/lifecycle/project-I/O/render/publication regressions also passed.
Portable CMake/build/CTest run `39748116580` passed. Local `make test` and a strict-warning
ASan/UBSan execution of the unchanged native engine sources passed. Local CMake was
not installed; do not confuse CI execution with a local run.

Verified published prerelease `phone-test-39748116540` targets the tested source;
APK `app-debug.apk` is 6,867,764 bytes and checksum asset is uploaded. Actions' optional
report artifact upload still exceeded storage quota; step outcomes/release metadata
were checked, but downloadable XML/lint reports were not independently inspected.
This is emulator/host evidence; physical-phone validation of the new library/navigation
is pending. The user's latest successful phone report refers to the earlier playhead
APK, not this architecture batch. Later documentation-only changes do not alter APK code.


Current architecture APK: https://github.com/islamyousuf032-glitch/New-cc/releases/download/phone-test-39748116540/app-debug.apk
Checksum: https://github.com/islamyousuf032-glitch/New-cc/releases/download/phone-test-39748116540/app-debug.apk.sha256


## Studio UI / Bengali-English checkpoint (2026-10-22)

User reports the project-workspace APK works well on their phone. This batch adds
an original slate/blue studio theme, card-based library, icon-only tool/navigation
actions with localized tooltips/accessibility, timeline lane/grid/clip polish, and
first-run English/Bengali selection persisted independently of project data. Home
Settings can change language. 256 default/Bengali resource pairs cover app-authored
menus, dialogs, statuses, export/recovery/errors; user names/media paths and native
diagnostics remain untouched. ADR 0010 records scope and platform references.

No new dependency, project schema, editing semantics or render preset. Current Flow
is still read-only. Host `make test`, resource/format/reference/contrast checks and
`git diff --check` passed; Android execution passed as recorded below.
This new visual design has not been visually inspected on a physical phone. Large
fonts, icon discovery, TalkBack, portrait/landscape and both-language provider flows
need device validation; do not claim host tests prove those.


### Studio UI batch — executed evidence

Final UI source `1e701d4b08bfcc71811fe54865101ce64db8098c`: Android run
`39764813788`, job `119777525804`, passed resource gate, APK build/lint,
AndroidTest compilation, alignment and full Android 35 x86_64 emulator regression.
New tests passed: mandatory first-run choice, Bengali context after recreation,
real Settings dialog selection back to English, preference retention, both-language
editor icon semantics/tooltips/minimum targets, icon bitmap unchanged by semantic
label length, and page switching without native timeline mutation. Existing project,
playhead, JNI, lifecycle, real-media render and publication regressions passed too.
Portable run `39764813603` passed resource gate, CMake configure/build and CTest.
Local `make test`, Python resource/reference/placeholder/contrast gate (256 pairs)
and diff check passed. No physical-phone visual/TalkBack/ergonomic validation yet.

Prerelease `phone-test-39764813788` targets that exact source; APK 7,018,288 bytes
and SHA-256 asset were verified as uploaded via release metadata. Optional Actions
report upload still exceeded storage quota: no independently downloaded XML/lint
report or full-screen screenshot review is claimed. Explicit CI step outcomes were
checked. Documentation-only follow-up does not change the tested APK implementation.

Current UI APK: https://github.com/islamyousuf032-glitch/New-cc/releases/download/phone-test-39764813788/app-debug.apk
Checksum: https://github.com/islamyousuf032-glitch/New-cc/releases/download/phone-test-39764813788/app-debug.apk.sha256


## Quiet editor / theme checkpoint (2026-10-22)

User phone screenshots show the studio-icon build works but still looks cluttered.
ADR 0011 records screenshot-driven hierarchy changes and official color-role research.
A fixed portrait editor prioritizes fitted viewer, transport, timeline and one focused
edit row; metadata/source seek, help and secondary/project tools are contextual.
Small-height/large-font windows retain a scroll fallback. Three persisted role-based
themes (Graphite, Midnight, Ember) share palette JSON and contrast tests. Home Settings
selects language or Appearance. Existing processing/render behavior is unchanged; Flow
is read-only. Quiet status retains important-failure/recovery notifications.

Resource/three-palette contrast checks and host tests are run below; Android layout/
theme/full regression and actual-phone aesthetic approval are separate gates. No new
dependency, proprietary assets, project migration, grade or node renderer added.


### Quiet editor / themes — verified execution

Code `cb5bfa7cc476b435f3fa6c35b68bcec0302b5a7e` passed Android run
`39777165014` / job `119818925802`: bilingual/three-theme contrast gate, build/lint,
AndroidTest compilation, APK alignment, and full Android 35 x86_64 emulator suite.
New tests verify quiet default Edit (no metadata/source slider/status/log toolbar),
one visible Play/Import, contextual Media/Tools, same viewer/timeline instances,
three persisted/recreated themes, and important failure notification deduplication.
Existing language/icon, playhead/real seek, history/lifecycle, project/library, render
and publication regression tests passed. Portable CMake/build/CTest run `39777165246`
passed. Local `make test`, 261-pair resource/contrast gate and diff check passed.

Verified prerelease `phone-test-39777165014` targets that exact source; uploaded APK
7,021,315 bytes plus SHA-256 asset. Optional Actions report upload hit storage quota;
step outcomes and release metadata were checked, not independently downloaded XML
or full-screen screenshots. Actual aesthetic approval, TalkBack, user font overrides,
short-window/large-font scrolling and phone codecs remain phone-validation tasks.
No claim that automated layout checks certify professional appearance.

## Phase B storage and install-over delivery checkpoint (2026-10-22)

User accepts quiet UI and requests planned substantive work, progress percentages and
full APK updates over the existing app. ADR 0012 and UPDATE_APKS define the delivery
contract and old-key limitation. New managed store owns a cooperative writer lease,
retained across rotation, checks bounded file fingerprints before native checkpoint,
validates recovery before replacing state, and guards catalog repair with metadata
archives. External Save As reports managed-primary conflict separately. Native edit
math/project schema unchanged; full coordinator/journal and node evaluator remain future.

CI now tests N−1→N install-over with real native project and actual app preferences,
and publishes only when durable signing + pinned certificate configuration is present.
Legacy random-debug-key compatibility is not promised. GitHub secret management
returned 403; owner-side setup is required, never passwords or keys in chat.

Readiness ledger v1 is a weighted scope estimate: baseline 25% credited, 75% remaining.
New managed storage 3 points remains pending Android gate; signing delivery is blocked,
not credited. Local core/resource, 7 mocked signer/manifest/reference-verifier scenarios and
3 emulator-reset refusal tests passed (metadata scenarios also with Python -O).
At source 8a6aab4, Android 39796552264/job119885073164 passed build/lint/alignment
and the full Android 35 x86_64 suite, but the separate install-over gate failed.
Its initial annotations were truncated by GitHub; diagnosis is not resolved.
Source a1bb412 Android 39799182223 failed before job startup: GitHub reports failed
account payment or spending-limit exhaustion. Latest diagnostic/reference-signer
and CI-only-emulator guard changes are host/syntax tested, not emulator verified.
No new APK was published; stable signing is not configured, and first-patch signer
must also match approved phone-test-39777165014. Do not uninstall/clear user data.

New cheap gates:
```
python3 tests/test_patch_metadata.py
python3 -O tests/test_patch_metadata.py
python3 tests/test_install_over_guard.py
python3 scripts/progress.py
```
The seven metadata scenarios mock SDK tool output; they do not cryptographically verify an
APK. Real verification uses SDK apksigner/aapt2/zipalign only in configured signing CI.
`UpdatePersistenceTest` methods intentionally skip in a normal full suite; CI selects
`#seed` / `#verify` explicitly across install-over. No uninstall/data-clear occurs
between seeding and verifying. Its fixture is a valid native project with test URIs,
not proof of phone media grants, codec behavior, or playability after updating.


### Native session coordinator checkpoint — 2026-10-22

Phase B now extracts native project/history ownership into C++20 SessionCoordinator
and routes JNI operations through it. Revision-checked 256-entry pages, failure
rollback, explicit save-copy/draft-restore and portable concurrency/recovery tests
are included. See ADR 0013 for contracts and limits. Host core/session tests, strict
CMake/CTest, ASan+UBSan and host JNI-header syntax checks passed. New Android bridge
tests are added but unrun; Activity orchestration and durable journal remain pending.
No graph evaluation, UI-memory virtualization, Android ABI/device verification or
install-over success is claimed. Readiness stays 25% credited / 75% remaining.
APK publication remains gated by UPDATE_APKS; earlier delivery blockers are not fixed
by this native refactor.

`make test` now builds/runs both core and native session executables. CMake adds
`owncut_session_tests` to CTest and links platform Threads. The session suite covers
rollback after partial mutation, revision/dirty behavior, snapshots, save failures,
corrupt load/recovery, copy/draft distinction, v0 load, ID collisions, track-boundary
pages, stale/invalid pages and simultaneous writers/readers. ASan/UBSan were run on
the session suite locally; TSan and Android tests were not run.

Android coordinator/checkpoint contract tests remain acceptance work. Per ADR 0014,
phone-test candidates may precede emulator execution but must disclose this; stable
signing and approved-signer/package/version verification remain mandatory.
