# Device test matrix

## Fresh-install exception (2026-10-24)

Current test candidate may require uninstall/fresh install by explicit user consent.
User must back up projects/media first; do not claim settings/project retention on uninstall.
Phone tests remain user-owned; build verification is not device acceptance (ADR0028).


## Verified Android build and sampler fix (2026-10-24)

Production code atb802517 passes Android40095688463: APK assembly, lint, Android test-source
compilation and ZIP alignment. Portable40095688482 passes native CTest and96×512production
GLSL/CPU cases on Mesa llvmpipe with unchanged2/255 RGB gate and exact alpha/identity/bypass.
Fixes: Format.NO_VALUE API and unavailable optional annotation; explicit highp sampler
instead of default lowp precision. Regression assertions added (ADR0027).

Historical UNCOMPILED/billing-startup statements below are superseded for this code; real
phone/live/encoder/export tests remain UNRUN. Stable signing not configured in these runs:
no downloadable update-compatible APK published. No guard removal/readiness credit;
25% complete/75% remaining. Phone testing remains user-owned.


## Android build checkpoint (2026-10-24)

Run40095260838 at47005f5 passed actual APK assembly, lint, Android test-source compilation
and ZIP alignment. Earlier UNCOMPILED statements below are historical; source is now
compiled, device/codec/live/export tests still UNRUN. Stable signing unavailable in that
run; no update-compatible candidate published. Host GLES failure remains separate/open.
No phone acceptance or readiness credit;25%/75%.


## Infrastructure recovery is not phone evidence (2026-10-24)

Alternate-runner/signing preflight changes require no user phone test now: no new APK
exists. Once build/signing succeeds, default candidate records device checks not-run;
phone testing remains user-owned. Signer/package/version verification is necessary but
not actual install-over/data-retention proof (ADR0026).


## Draft playback handoff — UNRUN (2026-10-24)

When a new update-compatible APK exists, user-owned phone acceptance includes draft
playback without saving/history change, bilingual/invalid entry, Before/play/pause,
return to editor with fields preserved, dirty-still/Apply feedback, editor close and
background release. These are pending acceptance items, not a request to run unavailable
binaries or a claim of assistant phone testing (ADR0025).


## Preview transport/still request gates — UNRUN (2026-10-24)

On a future update-compatible APK, user-owned phone checks: fail preflight/decode while
playing/buffering; close or background during preflight/error; verify no resumed audio,
late controls or held playback resources. Drag seek while playing/paused; thumb must not
jump, resume intent preserved; keyboard/TalkBack progress changes seek;100% must not target
EOS. Buffering allows pause, disables seek/Before. Check portrait/landscape/rotated/tiny/4K
still extraction, cancellation, bad metadata and wrong bitmap properties. API26 oversized
source must explain refusal; API27+ request stays within1280×720 without upscaling. Measure
actual decoder memory separately. Host policy coverage is NOT these device results;
Android build/APK and all these checks remain pending (ADR0024).


## Encoded grade comparison tests (2026-10-24)

- Host native metrics/JNI/Kotlin exact max/mean/bias/alpha and readonly/alias/stride tests
  passed;6native suites/ASan+UBSan. No new hardware/software GPU test here.
- GrayVideoFixture/GradedExportParityTest Android sources added, UNCOMPILED/UNRUN.
  Actual EGL surface/encoder, explicit metadata,3candidate outputs, duration and six
  decoded times across cut must be run; log OwncutColorParity diagnostics on failure.
- Proposed lossy gates are not phone measurements. Constant center gray does not verify
  full color/chroma/HDR, geometry, live display, timing/A-V, driver metadata or memory.
- Preserve strict failure, not skip/fallback. No guard removal/APK/install-over credit.


## Experimental live clip player (2026-10-24)

- Host native6/6, strict JNI/actual JVM/pinned Kotlin regressions and1001 overflow-safe
  progress mappings passed;298resources/3themes/17labels pass.
- LiveColorPreviewTest raw MediaFormat/missing/HDR gate source added; uncompiled/unrun.
- Must build/run actual default-renderer specialization and shared video graph; compare
  normal/graded/Before pixels, trimmed loop boundaries/audio sync, seek/pause/resume,
  rotation/PAR/crop, texture detach/background/reopen/close races, invalid source/format/
  GL capability, decoder reporting and memory/performance. No proof from source APIs alone.
- Legacy timeline and export guards stay; no APK/device/update acceptance (ADR0022).


## Color controls / still proxy / candidate runner (2026-10-23)

- Host native6/6, actual Kotlin/JNI pixel packing/grade/bypass/alpha/source and bilingual
  draft parser passed;294resources/3themes and17labels per language pass.
- ColorStillPreviewTest Bitmap/native and draft-vs-history tests added; candidate pre-cancel/
  guard/worker cleanup test added. Android compilation/execution UNRUN.
- Must verify dialog text/keyboard/scroll on3themes, Before/After, stale drafts/Cancel/Apply,
  undo/redo/checkpoint, rotation/dismiss/provider errors and real retrieval color metadata.
- Measure full-resolution frame retrieval memory (proxy scales only after extraction),
  background worker cancellation, native render responsiveness, actual candidate encoded
  output, live graded preview and compatible update. No APK/device/codec proof (ADR0021).


## Candidate decoder boundary (2026-10-23)

- Native decoded verifier/JNI/pure-Kotlin gate tests passed, CTest6/6 and ASan+UBSan.
- GuardedDecoderTest synthetic Codec proxy added: both rendered release overloads,
  unchanged timestamp, absent/changed/query-failing formats, terminal failure, cleanup/
  owner-thread handling. **Android compilation and execution unrun**.
- Actual default asset-loader thread/release behavior, decoder color-range/size reporting,
  coded-padding/crop/rotation normalization, source replacement/URI binding, rendered
  pixels, shared preview/seek/cancel/lifecycle and encoded output remain pending.
- CI39958756231 job never started (billing/spending), not device/compiler success.
  Guards remain, no APK or phone/install-over claim; user owns phone testing (ADR0020).


## Phase 1C source/plan continuation (2026-10-23)

- Host source admission/immutable-plan tests passed (6native suites, JNI200 combinations,
  HDR-static conflict, pure Kotlin/native cancellation/dedup/immutable recipes).
- ColorSourcePlanTest added: raw MediaFormat/ColorInfo mapping, candidate per-clip effects/
  clipping and shipping guards. **Android compilation/execution pending**.
- MediaExtractor provider errors/no-video/multi-video, permission/relink/source replacement,
  cancellation during provider I/O, decoded-format revalidation, actual candidate encoder,
  shared preview/seek/release/surface lifecycle and phone/patch acceptance all pending.
- Previous Android CI39950781623 never started (billing/spending); not a compiler result.
  No APK; user owns phone tests. Source-only composition is not rendered-video acceptance.


## Phase 1C candidate (2026-10-23) — no Android results yet

- Host native/reference: 6/6, native GPU ASan+UBSan, actual JNI/Kotlin recipes passed.
- Software ANGLE/SwiftShader: 96 cases ×512 pixels, max RGB error 1/255; exact alpha,
  identity/bypass/zero strength. This is NOT phone/GPU hardware/Media3/codec evidence.
- Added GradeGpuContractTest: explicit metadata/HDR refusal and EGL synthetic neutral/
  exposure/bypass RGBA, expected video-SDR gray128→184/alpha37. **Uncompiled/unrun**.
- Full Android adapter build/lint/ART, software-Mesa CI, real decoded input and encoded
  output parity, SDR range/rotation/geometry, seek/first-frame/pause/loop/split boundaries,
  background/surface recreation, release/error/cancel ownership all **pending**.
- Preview/export adapter not installed. Existing grade export guards remain; no new APK
  or compatible-update/device pass. User owns phone testing (ADR 0014/0018).


## Phase 1B handoff (2026-10-23; no new device result)

ClipGradePersistenceTest adds internal API/storage contract cases: managed save/reopen,
recovery, independent/shared-source clip grades, copy/reset/bypass, split/history and
active-grade export refusal. Full Android compilation/execution remain pending. There
are no live Color controls to phone-test yet. Older apps cannot read new v2 project
files; never uninstall/clear data as a migration workaround. Phase 1C must validate
actual graded preview/export before the guard is removed. Phone tests remain user-owned.

## Color phase 1A — host-only evidence (2026-10-23)

No Android/phone/GPU/encoded-video grade result. ColorEngineContractTest adds ART/ABI
CPU frame tests for actual pixels, alpha/source and bad-buffer refusal, but is not yet
compiled/run. Host production Kotlin/JNI tests are not Android acceptance. Live grading
is NOT wired into the editor, so do not ask the user to test nonexistent Color controls.
Later phase-one phone handoff requires save/reopen/undo/reset, before-after, seeking,
preview/export color-chart parity, alpha, lifecycle and output playback on a compatible
signed update. Phone testing remains user-owned; no uninstall/data-clear workaround.

## Lifetime/projection batch (2026-10-23; no new device results)

Once a signer-compatible update exists, user checks should include: long multi-clip
projects, scrolling/dragging near viewport edges, selection/undo/redo refresh, save/reopen,
project switching and rotation while save/load/recovery is busy. The native lifetime race
is host-tested; busy Activity recreation/writer-lease behavior is still an open gate.
Host Kotlin/JVM projection checks are not Android rendering or performance measurements.

## New batch handoff — 2026-10-23

**No new phone or emulator result.** Phone testing is owned by the user. Host JVM JNI,
C++ interruption hooks and sanitizers do not validate Android lifecycle/storage/codecs.
When a compatible signed update is available, the targeted user checklist is:

- Update without uninstall/data clear; existing projects, language/theme and media survive.
- Open multiple projects; save/reopen, import/edit/history and export still behave normally.
- Sources → page/select referenced media; confirm expected clip and preview.
- Use Bengali/emoji in supported names/URIs; save/reopen without replacement characters.
- Recover an offered draft explicitly; a receipt repair must not erase recovery or media.

Do not intentionally corrupt live documents for a phone smoke test. Detailed corruption/
interruption cases belong to disposable fixtures. Automated Android tests for the new
batch are written but compilation/execution are pending. Optional CI emulator tests are
manual opt-in and are not a prerequisite for the user's phone-testing handoff (ADR 0014).

The Galaxy F23 row below records a user-reported manual smoke test. Other rows remain planned targets. Emulator instrumentation passed in run `39603413359`; physical-phone reports are user observations, not independent measurements.

| Device / class | Coverage | Result / limits |
|---|---|---|
| Samsung Galaxy F23; Android 14; 6 GB RAM; Snapdragon 750G (user-reported) | User tried the app after the TextureView fix. Screenshot shows visible video from a 3840×1632, 9-second source and timeline UI; user says playback and features work. | **User smoke test reported successful** (2026-10-19). No independently captured codec details, A/V sync measurement, save/reopen, SAF project Save As/Open, export, lifecycle, thermal or frame-drop measurements. Do not infer universal 4K/codec support. |
| Low-memory phone | Lowest supported Android API; 4 GB RAM class | Planned: import, seek, surface recreation, storage exhaustion, background/foreground, thermal behavior |
| Mid-range phone | Current widely deployed API; 6–8 GB RAM | Planned: 1080p SDR decode/preview, A/V sync, trim/split, save/reopen, H.264/AAC export |
| High-end phone | Current API; modern GPU/codec | Planned: 1080p performance, dropped frames, export throughput, cancellation and thermal throttling |
| Tablet | Current API; large/adaptive display | Planned: landscape/adaptive UI, touch target/accessibility, surface and lifecycle behavior |

For each real device record manufacturer/model, SoC/GPU, Android build/API, ABI, codec capabilities, input sample provenance, project settings, measured frame time/dropped frames/RAM/temperature/export speed, and pass/fail artifacts. Test only advertised capability; do not infer universal 4K, 60 fps or HDR support. Add 16 KB page-size packaging/device coverage before native release.

## Initial phone smoke-test checklist

For new code builds, install the APK from the private `phone-test-*` prerelease (arm64-v8a and x86_64; verify the accompanying SHA-256 file). This is a manual debug build, not release acceptance.

1. **Completed by user (Galaxy F23):** user reports video playback and editing features work after the TextureView crash fix; supplied screenshot shows a visible frame from 3840×1632 media and timeline. This does not independently measure A/V sync, decoder support or playback performance.
2. Remaining playback validation: test a local 1080p SDR sample, pause/seek, adjacent clips and gaps; record audio sync and behavior after surface recreation. Avoid assuming universal 4K/HDR/codec support.
3. Test project Save As/Open from the Android Documents provider (included in `phone-test-39251452651`), plus app-private Save/Open saved and Recover autosave. Verify malformed or inaccessible project documents do not corrupt the current session.
4. For a moved or revoked source, select the affected timeline clip and use **মিডিয়া বদল**. Confirm a replacement with sufficient duration restores preview while retaining the source range; confirm a too-short replacement is rejected. After splitting one source into multiple clips, relink one segment and confirm all segments sharing that source update together; test undo/redo for the whole group.
5. Test rotation, background/foreground, low storage, revoked media permission, unsupported/corrupt media and lifecycle cleanup.
6. APK `phone-test-39270709637` includes the duration-rounding and explicit gap-compaction fix, but it still restricts export to one original source. Follow-up source now accepts multiple original URIs only when video/audio codec configurations and formats match, and probes the output MP4 plus decodes its first frame before copying. After a new APK is built, test one 6-second clip, three clips from the same source, and two or three compatible sources; verify Gallery thumbnail/playback, first/last frames, audio continuity, cancellation and failure cleanup. Also test mismatched resolution/codec rejection. Ask the user to attach the exported MP4 if Gallery still cannot create a thumbnail. Arbitrary-frame cuts, overlap, effects and re-encoding remain unsupported; this is not general export acceptance.

### Gallery publication follow-up

Android 10+ export saves validated MP4s automatically to `Movies/Owncut` using a pending MediaStore row; no document picker is shown. Android 8–9 retain the SAF picker. Failed/cancelled copies attempt cleanup; provider deletion may fail. Existing empty files are not automatically removed. Device checks must cover successful Gallery thumbnail/playback, cancellation, unsupported-keyframe/format rejection without a new Gallery item, and storage/write failure cleanup. This does not add re-encoding or `.ccraw` decoding; the custom RAW format specification and sample footage are still required. Android/device verification of this publication change is pending.

## Basic render checkpoint (2026-10-21, emulator verified)

Default export now routes through `TimelineRenderExporter` (Media3 1.8.1) instead of
stream-copy. The native timeline snapshot supplies clip order and source trim ranges;
Android decodes/renders/re-encodes H.264 + AAC, source video cadence, 720-high SDR, preserving aspect
ratio. A silent audio track is generated where necessary. Gap removal still needs
confirmation; overlaps/multitrack export remain rejected. Import/play/edit are existing
features; RAW and grading are explicitly deferred until basic acceptance is complete.

New real-media instrumentation covers untouched input, non-keyframe trim, three clips
with different resolutions/aspects and a silent source, duration, output first/last
frames and pre-start cancellation. Synthetic fixture provenance is in androidTest/assets.
Run `39603413359` executed the instrumentation suite successfully, including the
new real-media render cases. Galaxy F23 playback/A/V sync, mid-render cancellation,
Gallery thumbnails and lifecycle still need physical-device verification. APK publication
is gated after emulator instrumentation and `phone-test-39603413359` is published; do not distribute the prior remux APK as this
render checkpoint. Earlier remux-only descriptions above are historical, not the new
selected UI path.

## Follow-up phone report — 2026-10-21

The user reports that the latest supplied basic-render APK works well: imported
approximately 5–6 videos, split/edited them, removed empty ranges, rendered and
played the 720p result. Record as successful user-reported sequential multi-source
render smoke test on the previously identified Galaxy F23, not measured A/V sync,
all-codec support, cancellation, persistence, thermal or lifecycle acceptance.

## Basic reliability milestone (emulator regression verified)

Next scope selected by the user: basic editor hardening, not grading/RAW or MVP tools.
New source guards grouped-source relink durations, blocks edits during project I/O,
retains editor history/selection on export-time recreation while cancelling the old
render, preserves paused preview position and clamps seeks to the selected clip.
Gallery publication now uses a testable pending-row transaction with copy/close/size/
publish checks and explicit cleanup-failure reporting. Output duration and first/last
frame decoding are checked before publication. Android run `39620910796` executed the expanded JNI, real-codec, Activity
recreation, MediaStore and injected storage-failure suite successfully after the
initial regression failures were fixed. Build/lint and 16 KB alignment also passed.
Published APK: `phone-test-39620910796` from `4fc4590` (6,809,848 bytes).

Phone checks still needed: exact A/V sync, permission revocation/provider save/reopen,
low storage, Samsung lifecycle/process death. SAVE/LOAD/RECOVER-time recreation still
uses explicit autosave recovery, not background operation handoff. No provider-atomic
replacement, write-ahead journal, full shared preview/export graph, multitrack, grading
or RAW claim is added. Existing user-confirmed 5–6-clip 720p rendering remains valid.

### Reliability checkpoint results

Media import now participates in C++ AddClipCommand Undo/Redo history, including
last-import undo clearing preview. MP4 validation iterates by sample-track index so
negative AAC pre-roll timestamps are not mistaken for EOF. Regression tests were
not weakened after the first failing run. New hardening has emulator evidence, not
a new Galaxy F23 report; that phone's successful 5–6-clip render report concerns the
previous basic-render APK. Project schema is unchanged and reopen resets transient
history, as before. Save important work as a project document before changing debug
APK installations; do not delete app data to resolve installation errors without backup.

## Timeline interaction checkpoint — verified emulator batch (2026-10-22)

User reports the basic-hardening APK works correctly on their phone, with some
unspecified remaining issues. This requested batch adds an original red timeline
playhead, HH:MM:SS:FF ruler/time label, unified lane scrolling, tap-to-seek, marker-head
scrubbing, follow toggle/manual browse, proportional short clips/adaptive long scale,
source/sequence time separation and Undo anchor preservation. Native C++ owns point
lookup, exclusive clip boundaries and gap/overlap validation. Android preview now
requests closest-frame seeks and waits for initial seek completion before playback.
No project schema/output-preset/new dependency or advanced-tool/RAW claim is added.

See DECISIONS/0008 for research, clock/conversion/interaction details and test scope.
Host `make test` and `git diff --check` passed. Final code `8f5df51` passed
portable CI `39728248775` and Android CI `39728248796` (job `119657088154`):
APK build/lint, AndroidTest compilation, 16 KB alignment and the full Android 35
x86_64 emulator suite, including the new Canvas/touch/JNI/real-MediaPlayer seek,
playback advancement, split/Undo and non-selected clip move/source checks. Existing
render, publication, project-I/O and lifecycle tests also passed.
Phone-test prerelease: `phone-test-39728248796`, target
`8f5df51622fec4bd29542921875b330905c475b9`, APK 6,834,920 bytes.
This is emulator evidence, not a new physical-phone validation report.
Device checks still needed: red-marker smoothness/latency, fast repeated seeks, long
clip/zoomed timeline ergonomics, TalkBack/large fonts, source codecs and exact A/V sync.
The prior export gap-confirmation and single-track render limitations remain.


## Project-workspace / node architecture baseline (2026-10-22)

The user reports the playhead APK works well on their phone; this is user smoke
evidence, not an independent sync/performance benchmark. [Advanced architecture v1](ADVANCED_ARCHITECTURE.md)
and ADR 0009 now define the canonical forward design; earlier checkpoint descriptions
above are historical. The baseline distinguishes timeline editorial time, typed node
processing, contextual workspace UI, managed persistence and future shared evaluation.

This implementation adds a launcher project library (create/name/import/list/open),
per-project native save/recovery, non-destructive legacy workspace discovery, managed
checkpoint on Projects/Back, retained workspace pages and Edit/Media/Deliver panels.
Flow is a read-only explanation of the current separate preview/export routes. Native
`engine/graph` validates a bounded typed output DAG but has no renderer, JNI or file
schema integration. No advanced grading/audio/RAW/compositor or output-preset claim.

Host tests and Android verification for this batch are recorded in the final evidence
entry below when executed. Physical-phone verification of this new navigation is pending.
Test on phone: create two projects, import/edit/back/reopen isolation, external Save As,
legacy recovery, large fonts/rotation, media relink, render/Gallery, and Back during I/O.


### Executed architecture-batch evidence

Final implementation `f652c381316d209eb6be2bb5b736c89ede802e12` passed Android
run `39748116540` / job `119721585167`: APK build/lint, AndroidTest compilation,
16 KB alignment, KVM and full Android 35 x86_64 instrumentation. New catalog tests
cover isolated documents, names/path validation, non-destructive/idempotent legacy
migration, malformed/oversized metadata with valid cards preserved, launcher routing,
managed checkpoint/reopen and retained workspace page without replacing the viewer.
Existing playhead/JNI/lifecycle/project-I/O/render/publication regressions also passed.
Portable CMake/build/CTest run `39748116580` passed. Local `make test` and a strict-warning
ASan/UBSan execution of the unchanged native engine sources passed. Local CMake was
not installed; do not confuse CI execution with a local run.

Verified published prerelease `phone-test-39748116540` targets the tested source;
APK `app-debug.apk` is 6,867,764 bytes and checksum asset is uploaded. Actions' optional
report artifact upload still exceeded storage quota; step outcomes/release metadata
were checked, but downloadable XML/lint reports were not independently inspected.
This is emulator/host evidence; physical-phone validation of the new library/navigation
is pending. The user's latest successful phone report refers to the earlier playhead
APK, not this architecture batch. Later documentation-only changes do not alter APK code.


## Studio UI / Bengali-English checkpoint (2026-10-22)

User reports the project-workspace APK works well on their phone. This batch adds
an original slate/blue studio theme, card-based library, icon-only tool/navigation
actions with localized tooltips/accessibility, timeline lane/grid/clip polish, and
first-run English/Bengali selection persisted independently of project data. Home
Settings can change language. 256 default/Bengali resource pairs cover app-authored
menus, dialogs, statuses, export/recovery/errors; user names/media paths and native
diagnostics remain untouched. ADR 0010 records scope and platform references.

No new dependency, project schema, editing semantics or render preset. Current Flow
is still read-only. Host `make test`, resource/format/reference/contrast checks and
`git diff --check` passed; Android execution passed as recorded below.
This new visual design has not been visually inspected on a physical phone. Large
fonts, icon discovery, TalkBack, portrait/landscape and both-language provider flows
need device validation; do not claim host tests prove those.


### Studio UI batch — executed evidence

Final UI source `1e701d4b08bfcc71811fe54865101ce64db8098c`: Android run
`39764813788`, job `119777525804`, passed resource gate, APK build/lint,
AndroidTest compilation, alignment and full Android 35 x86_64 emulator regression.
New tests passed: mandatory first-run choice, Bengali context after recreation,
real Settings dialog selection back to English, preference retention, both-language
editor icon semantics/tooltips/minimum targets, icon bitmap unchanged by semantic
label length, and page switching without native timeline mutation. Existing project,
playhead, JNI, lifecycle, real-media render and publication regressions passed too.
Portable run `39764813603` passed resource gate, CMake configure/build and CTest.
Local `make test`, Python resource/reference/placeholder/contrast gate (256 pairs)
and diff check passed. No physical-phone visual/TalkBack/ergonomic validation yet.

Prerelease `phone-test-39764813788` targets that exact source; APK 7,018,288 bytes
and SHA-256 asset were verified as uploaded via release metadata. Optional Actions
report upload still exceeded storage quota: no independently downloaded XML/lint
report or full-screen screenshot review is claimed. Explicit CI step outcomes were
checked. Documentation-only follow-up does not change the tested APK implementation.


## Quiet editor / theme checkpoint (2026-10-22)

User phone screenshots show the studio-icon build works but still looks cluttered.
ADR 0011 records screenshot-driven hierarchy changes and official color-role research.
A fixed portrait editor prioritizes fitted viewer, transport, timeline and one focused
edit row; metadata/source seek, help and secondary/project tools are contextual.
Small-height/large-font windows retain a scroll fallback. Three persisted role-based
themes (Graphite, Midnight, Ember) share palette JSON and contrast tests. Home Settings
selects language or Appearance. Existing processing/render behavior is unchanged; Flow
is read-only. Quiet status retains important-failure/recovery notifications.

Resource/three-palette contrast checks and host tests are run below; Android layout/
theme/full regression and actual-phone aesthetic approval are separate gates. No new
dependency, proprietary assets, project migration, grade or node renderer added.


### Quiet editor / themes — verified execution

Code `cb5bfa7cc476b435f3fa6c35b68bcec0302b5a7e` passed Android run
`39777165014` / job `119818925802`: bilingual/three-theme contrast gate, build/lint,
AndroidTest compilation, APK alignment, and full Android 35 x86_64 emulator suite.
New tests verify quiet default Edit (no metadata/source slider/status/log toolbar),
one visible Play/Import, contextual Media/Tools, same viewer/timeline instances,
three persisted/recreated themes, and important failure notification deduplication.
Existing language/icon, playhead/real seek, history/lifecycle, project/library, render
and publication regression tests passed. Portable CMake/build/CTest run `39777165246`
passed. Local `make test`, 261-pair resource/contrast gate and diff check passed.

Verified prerelease `phone-test-39777165014` targets that exact source; uploaded APK
7,021,315 bytes plus SHA-256 asset. Optional Actions report upload hit storage quota;
step outcomes and release metadata were checked, not independently downloaded XML
or full-screen screenshots. Actual aesthetic approval, TalkBack, user font overrides,
short-window/large-font scrolling and phone codecs remain phone-validation tasks.
No claim that automated layout checks certify professional appearance.


## Phase B storage and install-over delivery checkpoint (2026-10-22)

User accepts quiet UI and requests planned substantive work, progress percentages and
full APK updates over the existing app. ADR 0012 and UPDATE_APKS define the delivery
contract and old-key limitation. New managed store owns a cooperative writer lease,
retained across rotation, checks bounded file fingerprints before native checkpoint,
validates recovery before replacing state, and guards catalog repair with metadata
archives. External Save As reports managed-primary conflict separately. Native edit
math/project schema unchanged; full coordinator/journal and node evaluator remain future.

CI now tests N−1→N install-over with real native project and actual app preferences,
and publishes only when durable signing + pinned certificate configuration is present.
Legacy random-debug-key compatibility is not promised. GitHub secret management
returned 403; owner-side setup is required, never passwords or keys in chat.

Readiness ledger v1 is a weighted scope estimate: baseline 25% credited, 75% remaining.
New managed storage 3 points remains pending Android gate; signing delivery is blocked,
not credited. Local core/resource, 7 mocked signer/manifest/reference-verifier scenarios and
3 emulator-reset refusal tests passed (metadata scenarios also with Python -O).
At source 8a6aab4, Android 39796552264/job119885073164 passed build/lint/alignment
and the full Android 35 x86_64 suite, but the separate install-over gate failed.
Its initial annotations were truncated by GitHub; diagnosis is not resolved.
Source a1bb412 Android 39799182223 failed before job startup: GitHub reports failed
account payment or spending-limit exhaustion. Latest diagnostic/reference-signer
and CI-only-emulator guard changes are host/syntax tested, not emulator verified.
No new APK was published; stable signing is not configured, and first-patch signer
must also match approved phone-test-39777165014. Do not uninstall/clear user data.


### Native session coordinator checkpoint — 2026-10-22

Phase B now extracts native project/history ownership into C++20 SessionCoordinator
and routes JNI operations through it. Revision-checked 256-entry pages, failure
rollback, explicit save-copy/draft-restore and portable concurrency/recovery tests
are included. See ADR 0013 for contracts and limits. Host core/session tests, strict
CMake/CTest, ASan+UBSan and host JNI-header syntax checks passed. New Android bridge
tests are added but unrun; Activity orchestration and durable journal remain pending.
No graph evaluation, UI-memory virtualization, Android ABI/device verification or
install-over success is claimed. Readiness stays 25% credited / 75% remaining.
APK publication remains gated by UPDATE_APKS; earlier delivery blockers are not fixed
by this native refactor.
